# Introduction

Inferring familial relationships between individuals using genetic data is a common problem in population genetics, medical genetics, and forensics. There are multiple approaches to estimating the relatedness between samples, including genome-wide relatedness measures such as those implemented in Plink [@purcell2007] or KING [@manichaikul2010], and methods that rely on identity by descent (IBD) segment detection such as GERMLINE [@gusev2009], hap-IBD [@zhou2020], and IBIS [@seidman2020]. Recent efforts have focused on benchmarking these methods [@ramstetter2017; @vries2021] aided by tools for simulating pedigrees and genome-wide SNP data [@caballero2019]. Analyzing results from genome-wide SNP-based kinship analysis or comparing analyses to simulated data for benchmarking have to this point required writing one-off analysis functions or utility scripts that are rarely shared, poorly documented, and at best, have an inconsistent design and API across multiple developers and programming languages. Here we present the skater R package for **S**NP-based **k**inship **a**nalysis, **t**esting, and **e**valuation.

Details of all funding sources for the work in question should be given in a separate section entitled 'Funding'. This should appear before the 'Acknowledgements' section.

# Funding {.unnumbered}

The following rules should be followed:

-   The sentence should begin: 'This work was supported by ...' -
-   The full official funding agency name should be given, i.e. 'National Institutes of Health', not 'NIH' (full RIN-approved list of UK funding agencies)
-   Grant numbers should be given in brackets as follows: '[grant number xxxx]'
-   Multiple grant numbers should be separated by a comma as follows: '[grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]'
-   Agencies should be separated by a semi-colon (plus 'and' before the last funding agency)
-   Where individuals need to be specified for certain sources of funding the following text should be added after the relevant agency or grant number 'to [author initials]'.

An example is given here: 'This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [AA123456 to C.S., BB765432 to M.H.]; and the Alcohol & Education Research Council [hfygr667789].'
