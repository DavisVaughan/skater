\abstract{
\textbf{Motivation:} This section should specifically state the
scientific question within the context of the field of study.\\
\textbf{Results:} This section should summarize the scientific advance
or novel results of the study, and its impact on computational
biology.\\
\textbf{Availability:} This section should state software availability
if the paper focuses mainly on software development or on the
implementation of an algorithm. Examples are: `Freely available on the
web at XXX.' Website implemented in Perl, MySQL and Apache, with all
major browsers supported'; or `Source code and binaries freely available
for download at URL, implemented in C++ and supported on linux and MS
Windows'. The complete address (URL) should be given. If the manuscript
describes new software tools or the implementation of novel algorithms
the software must be freely available to non-commercial users. Authors
must also ensure that the software is available for a full TWO YEARS
following publication. The editors of Bioinformatics encourage authors
to make their source code available and, if possible, to provide access
through an open source license.\\

\tightlist
\item
  The sentence should begin: `This work was supported by \ldots{}' -
\item
  The full official funding agency name should be given, i.e.~`National
  Institutes of Health', not `NIH' (full RIN-approved list of UK funding
  agencies)
\item
  Grant numbers should be given in brackets as follows: `{[}grant number
